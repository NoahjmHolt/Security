Encryption Type Comparisons

Over Arching Goal
===========================================================


Research and Basics
===========================================================
Recently completed project for another class where a similar time comparison was needed
Will use similar format by log stop time, calling function, log stop time
    Want to just write a wrapper function that returns time taken.


Issues Encountered
===========================================================
Issue 1:
My Mac did not recognize the Crypto.Cipher package and so was showing it as an error.
It took me way to long to realize that it was possibly a Mac issue because I have a M1 chipset.
Resolution:

Issue 2:
