A history of Middle earth: (facts from lord of the rings)

    One thing many don't know is that middle earth,
    where the story takes place, is only a super small
    chunk of the world imagined by J.R.R Tolkien

    Another thing that movie watchers don't understand
    is that between Bilbo's 111th birthday and Frodo's 33rd
    Gandalf returning to the shire is a 30 year gap where
    Frodo, like Bilbo previously, is said to have not aged
    do to the rings influence just being in his hole.
    (that would be a hobit hole, get your head out the gutter.)

    Aragorn's age is astounding for a human as well, during the
    start of the journey, he is 87 years old already. many
    believe it is due to his love for Arwen and his closeness
    to the elves (which is almost right), but it is due to his
    NÃºmenor lineage as the elves blessed those of the island
    with longer lives for their help in the defeat of Morgoth
    in th 584th year of the second age.

    Movie goers also miss the point in the first film where
    Frodo moves to in Buckland (part of the shire) to hide that
    he will be off on an adventure to deliver the ring and
    on the day he is leaving is when he runs into some elves
    that tell him that all are leaving middle earth and that is
    also how Merry and Pipin join the story.
